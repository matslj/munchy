1. Munchy, Download + Install
 
Munchy is on GitHub.
 
  http://github.com/matslj/munchy/
 
Download it and then change the following define in 'config.php':

- define('WS_SITELINK',   'http://<your domain + path to where index.php is located>/'); // Link to site.

So if you for example have your index.php in localhost/munchy/ then the above define should read:

define('WS_SITELINK',   'http://localhost/munchy/'); // Link to site.

Then point a browser to your installed version of Munchy. Voila! Done.

But to get all the facilities of Munchy up and running, you also have to config the database. To do this
edit the file <your install directory>/sql/config.php with information about your database. Then,
back in the browser, pointing at your installed version of munchy, click 'Install' and then
'Destroy current database and create from scratch'. This creates the necessary tables and stored routines as well
as populating the tables with some example data.

Now the complete power of Munchy is at your hands.
 
An example of a pure standard installation of Munchy is available here. Review it before moving
on.
